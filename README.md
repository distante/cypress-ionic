## The Problem

To be able to get a hold of Ionic's web components and with Cypress one has to inspect their ShadowDom and create cypress helper commands to change them for each project, which is time consuming.

With this library you can just give the css selector of the Ionic Element, or the element itself and you can interact with it in an easy way.

## Install

`npm install @saninn/cypress-ionic`.

Then enable ShadowDom access on your Cypress Project:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://on.cypress.io/cypress.schema.json",
  "includeShadowDom": true,
  ...
}
```

\*\* Although it is not needed, it is recommended to disable Ionic animations when possible. That said, this library let the animations active so timing issues are handled.

## Basic usage

Each helper function returns an `Cypress.Chainable<JQuery<IonComponent>>` object with the component that was changed. So an example of usage could be

```ts
import { ionRangeCypress } from '@saninn/cypress';

it('can be changed by set value', () => {
  ionRangeCypress.setValue('ion-range.my-ion-range', 42);

  cy.get('my-view-item').should('eq', '42');
});
```
